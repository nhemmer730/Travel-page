                    <h2>Why Lucca</h2>
                    <h3>Lucca, Renaisssance-era walled city</h3>
                    <p>Lucca is a city and comune in Tuscany, Central Italy, on the Serchio River, in a
                        fertile plain near the Ligurian Sea. The city has a population of about 89,000, while its
                        province has a population
                        of 383,957.

                        Lucca is known as an Italian "Citt√† d'arte" (City of Art) from its intact Renaissance-era city
                        walls and its very
                        well preserved historic center, where, among other buildings and monuments, are located the
                        Piazza
                        dell'Anfiteatro,
                        which has its origins in the second half of the 1st century A.D. and the Guinigi Tower, a
                        45-metre-tall (150 ft) tower
                        that dates from the 1300s.

                        The city is also the birthplace of numerous world-class composers, including Giacomo Puccini,
                        Alfredo Catalani, and
                        Luigi Boccherini.
