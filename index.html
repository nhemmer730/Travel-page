                    <h2>Why Lucca</h2>
                    <h3>Lucca: the city of 100 churches</h3>
                    <p>Lucca is a city and comune in Tuscany, Central Italy, on the Serchio River, in a
                        fertile plain near the Ligurian Sea. The city has a population of about 89,000, while its
                        province has a population
                        of 383,957.

                        Lucca is known as an Italian "Citt√† d'arte" (City of Art) from its intact Renaissance-era city
                        walls and its very
                        well preserved historic center, where, among other buildings and monuments, are located the
                        Piazza
                        dell'Anfiteatro,
                        which has its origins in the second half of the 1st century A.D. and the Guinigi Tower, a
                        45-metre-tall (150 ft) tower
                        that dates from the 1300s.

                        The city is also the birthplace of numerous world-class composers, including Giacomo Puccini,
                        Alfredo Catalani, and
                        Luigi Boccherini.

                            <h4>Torre Guinigi</h4>
                            <p>The Torre Guinigi was built during the second half of the fourteenth century. At one
                                point
                                Lucca had over 200 defensive towers, there are now 9 that remain. It is recognizable by
                                the
                                trees that were planted by the Guinigi family in the garden in the top. The tower is 45
                                meters high with 233 steps to reach the top. </p>

                            <p>My last night in Italy, I climbed this tower. It was a beautiful, summer night and I
                                still
                                remember
                                how peaceful it was up there overlooking the city.</p>

                                The Magdalene Bridge (Ponte della Maddalena), known as the Devil's Bridge, is one of the
                                most original constructions in

                                It's deceptively beautiful in person and the history of its construction is minimal. It
                                is believed to be constructed around 1046.
